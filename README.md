# Design_Pattern
 
1. **Singleton Pattern:** Creating a single instance of a class that has a global access.
2. **Factory Pattern:** When deciding between protocol integrated classes and base classes, the factory pattern in swift is required.(hide the complexity of an instance of object).
3. **Dependency Injection:** Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. It achieves that by decoupling the usage of an object from its creation. This helps you to follow SOLIDâ€™s dependency inversion and single responsibility principles.
4. **Facade Pattern:** Facade allows us to simplify the way we interact with complicated APIs by hiding the internal implementation details under the hood and exposing simple methods for the client.
5. **Delegate Pattern:** Delegate patterns enable objects to communicate back to their owners decoupled from their code.(one-to-one communication)
